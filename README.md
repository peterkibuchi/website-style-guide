## General Information
- Developers and designers use style guides/design systems in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web application.
- Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.
- As websites grow larger and more complex, having a consistent set of styles help them stay cohesive and enjoyable for users.
- It also helps as you start working with other developers, as you can have a consistent reference for how your website should be built.
- This style guide only includes a section on colors, fonts, and specific text styles, but it can be extended to as many other areas.
- I undertook this project as a means of taking my CSS skills to the next level.


## Technologies Used
* HTML & CSS


## Project Status

## Room for Improvement

- Add additional style components.
- Implement a responsive design so that the site looks great on all screen sizes.
- Add navigation and splitting up the site so that each section has its own HTML page.
